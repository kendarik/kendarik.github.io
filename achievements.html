    <h2> School </h2>
    <p>As said before, Ryan is a very famous figure in Han Chiang High School. With his magnificent talents, he has managed to receive a consolation prize in the caligraphy competition, thanks to his Chinese teacher, 林老师, his friends, and parents.</p>
    <h2> Co-curricular activities </h2>
    <p> Sadly, so far Ryan has not participated in any competitions. But I'm sure that won't stop him! #RyanForPrez</p>
