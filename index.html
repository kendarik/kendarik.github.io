					<h4>English</h4>
					<p>Ryan has always pushed himself to do the best he can. English, while a subject he enjoyed, could be a bit of a challenge at times. One memorable moment came during his English exam, where he scored 84. It wasn&apos;t a perfect score, but it was a solid reflection of his hard work and understanding of the material. It demonstrated his ability to overcome challenges and achieve success, even if it wasn't flawless. It also motivated him to continue refining his skills and striving for even greater accomplishments in the future.</p>

					<h4>Chinese</h4>
					<p>Chinese has always been a subject Ryan has found particularly challenging, and it was no surprise that his exam results reflected that. He scored a 60—just above the passing grade. While it wasn&apos;t the result he had hoped for, Ryan took it as an important learning experience. That grade pushed Ryan to seek extra help and find new strategies for mastering the language, motivating him to work harder and aim for better results in the future.</p>

					<h4>Bahasa Malaysia</h4>
					<p>Bahasa Malaysia has always been a subject Ryan felt fairly comfortable with. When he received a 74 on his exam, RYan thought it was alright—not great, but not bad either. It wasn&apos;t a score that stood out, but it reflected the effort he put in and his understanding of the language. Overall, it was just another step Ryan&apos;s learning journey.</p>

					<h4>Mathematics</h4>
					<p>Mathematics had always been a subject that pushed Ryan to his limits, but when he saw the 69 on his exam, he couldn&apos;t help but feel angry with himself. He knew he could have done better, and it stung that he had fallen so short of his own expectations. To Ryan, a 69 was far from acceptable—it was a reminder of the mistakes he made, the areas he neglected, and the effort he hadn&apos;t fully given. He couldn&apos;t shake the feeling of disappointment, thinking about how he had let himself down. It wasn’t a failure, but it sure felt like one.</p>

					<h4>Science</h4>
					<p>Science was a subject Ryan generally felt comfortable with, and when he saw his 76 on the exam, he felt a sense of relief. It wasn&apos;t a perfect score, but it was solid, and he knew he had put in the effort. For Ryan, a 76 felt like a fair reflection of his understanding—it wasn&apos;t the highest, but it showed he was on the right track. He was satisfied with the result, knowing there was room for improvement, but also recognizing that his hard work paid off.</p>

					<h4>Geography</h4>
					<p>Geography had always been one of Ryan's favorite subjects, but when he saw the 82 on his exam, he couldn&apos;t believe it—it was the highest score he had ever received in his life. For Ryan, that 82 felt like a huge achievement, something he&apos;d never thought possible before. It wasn&apos;t a perfect score, but it was the best he had ever done, and that made it all the more special. He felt an overwhelming sense of pride, knowing that his dedication and hard work had led to this milestone. That score was a turning point for Ryan, reminding him that with effort and focus, he could achieve more than he ever expected.</p>
